      <p><strong>DEFINTION:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Using of colored clothes are cannot be aloud or tolerated during Tuesday’s and Friday’s and white t-shirt with print can be even more wearable because it looks more formal within the students. Using of white t-shirts with print could have been worn by the students. There are many students who have little pure white clothes and colored dresses and stripes are not required in school campus because they are not formal looking at the school when uniform time. And our advocacy is to enforces the school to use of white clothes with print and for no students discharged when they are dressed in white with print clothes. </em></p>
      <p><strong>WHAT TO DO: </strong></p>
      <p><em>Make a request letter to the principal for allowing those students who’s wearing a printed white t-shirt. </em></p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE: </b></p>
      <p><em>The advantage of using printed white t-shirt is that many students can express themselves through using this one and make them comfortable but the disadvantages of using this one is that students might not use the prescribed uniform at all it is or to use this printed white t-shirt if and only if the prescribed uniform is unwashed or in some instances, it was destroyed and doesn’t have a replace yet. </em></p>
      <p><b>OUTCOMES: </b></p>
      <p><em>• Less hassle </em></p>
      <p><em>• Students will be inspired coming to school without thinking what to wear. </em></p>
      <p><em>• More comfortable for students. </em></p>
