      <p><strong>Definition </strong><br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bullying</strong>,<em> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bullying is any unwanted aggressive behavior by another child or group of children, who are not siblings or current dating partners, involving an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Cyberbullying</strong><em> is electronic aggression that occurs through the use of technology — hurtful words, photos or video sent through email or via instant or text message, or posted on a website or social media. </em></p>
      <p><strong> What is the advocacy all about? </strong></p>
      <p><em>The “No to Bullying” communication campaign is an advocacy that seeks to help arrest the growing and worsening incidence of bullying in schools, particularly in the elementary and secondary levels. The target audiences of the “No to Bullying” campaign are school administrators, teachers, parents, children who do the bullying, and the victims they are bullying. Their respective rights and responsibilities under the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 are tackled in the campaign, as well as the proper procedures in handling and dealing with bullying cases. </em></p>
      <p><strong>The template defines bullying and harassment as follows: </strong></p>
      <p><em></em></p>
      <p><em>“Bullying” is conduct that meets all of the following criteria: </em></p>
      <p><em>• is reasonably perceived as being dehumanizing, intimidating, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or otherwise likely to evoke fear of physical harm or emotional distress; </em></p>
      <p><em>• is directed at one or more pupils; • is conveyed through physical, verbal, technological or emotional means; </em></p>
      <p><em>• substantially interferes with educational opportunities, benefits, or programs of one or more pupils; </em></p>
      <p><em>• adversely affects the ability of a pupil to participate in or benefit from the school district’s or public school’s educational programs or activities by placing the pupil in reasonable fear of physical harm or by causing emotional distress; and, </em></p>
      <p><em>At the very least, school district policies must be publicly posted and define bullying behavior, harassment behavior, and the protocols for reporting it. Schools are responsible for addressing all complaints. Given that bullying behavior is a repeated behavior or one most likely to be repeated, not all mean behaviors will be classified as bullying. It is still important, however, to address such meanness and the impact it can have on a student’s wellbeing. The first step is to never minimize the concern you have for a student. No student should ever have to mitigate their own bullying situation. It is the school’s responsibility to investigate the matter in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner. It is our job to report the behavior and schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the results and steps to ensure the student’s safety and wellbeing. For situations that cause significant concern for you and/or the student, include the counselor and an administrator in your initial contact. Doing so will alert the school to proceed with a bullying investigation. </em></p>
